# CSCE 676 – Data Mining Project

## Project Checkpoint 1

### Selected Dataset
Slashdot0902 Directed Social Network (SNAP)

### Course Techniques
- Graph Mining (directed graph construction, SCC/WCC)
- Centrality Analysis (PageRank, HITS)
- Network Structure Analysis (degree distribution, reciprocity)

### Beyond-Course Technique
- Causal Effect Estimation Prototype (Propensity Score Weighting / IPW + Regression Adjustment)
- Pseudo-temporal Edge Split (train/test edge holdout to approximate “past→future” link growth)

### How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells sequentially.
